**Text Mining: WORK FROM HOME**

**Objective**

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of workers in the U.S. have been forced to work remotely. According to a Forbes report , "Pre-pandemic, roughly five percent of full-time employees with office jobs worked primarily from home. That figure is likely to settle at 20-30 percent in the new normal." A survey by the Pew Research Center  shows that 20% of employees worked from home all or most of the time before the pandemic, 71% currently work from home, and 54% would like to work from home after the pandemic ends. Most of them have found it very easy or somewhat easy to work from home.

In this analysis we attempted to uncover how people feel about working from home in general, and what else is on peopleâ€™s mind relating to working from home. Has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people's attitudes and thoughts?
