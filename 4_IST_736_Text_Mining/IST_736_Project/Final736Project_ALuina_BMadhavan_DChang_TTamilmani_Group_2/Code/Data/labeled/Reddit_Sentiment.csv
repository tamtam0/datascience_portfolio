2019-04-04 17:04:38+00:00,Team of  IT guys handling over  endusers I was hired as help desk last May at k a year and am now responsible for both ERPs we use modifying SQL scripts writing light Powershell EDI managing Exchange  our phone systems Active Directory  administering servers running on everything from Server  yes you read that right to Server    What if I told you that youre no longer help desk and have evolved to sysadmin You remind me of a younger me   The tickets are piling up   currently in our queue  Im the young guy low end on the totem pole with all this responsibility informally dumped on him without any increase in pay   Ignore the number of tickets Seriously  one day we lost power to our primary datacenter and had tickets rolling in at a steady   day for the better part of a month because of it Get numb to that Ok numb is a stretch How about let it roll off your back its not worth stressing about There are only so many hours in the day and only so many hours a day you should be expected to give a fuck Got a pile of after hours work Make it a short day in the office or come in later in the day the next day My rule of thumb anything that runs later than I would normally stay up on any given night Im sleeping in the next day   Im having to reverse engineer workflows to fix issues that the previous IT guys that quit left no documentation on what they did   Heres a secret no one tells you in IT No one documents anything due to the comical nature of shitty PMs timelines that get moved up outta nowhere and managers demanding you move onto the next project yesterday Documentation time is downtime Reverse engineering other peoples work is commonplace Once we found out an exsystem admin decided to create scheduled tasks to move files around because a user just couldnt be bothered to move where they were saving files on the nas so workflows for a very important daily report continued to work Said server was decommed as no one saw any installed programs on it it was labeled dev and we appeared to be just hanging out there consuming resources We decommed it and then the next day the report didnt run To anyone producing said report nothing changed It was only after a  hour P call that we found out exsys admin fixed user stupidity in a way that none of us would have thought of ever doing    I cant go to the bathroom without missing atleast  phone call from someone about something breaking   Ignore it Sometimes if Im in the zone writing scripts or working on something that I need to get done I set my phone on donotdisturb and will only look at it one every other hour or so Its not the end of the world if user problems dont get fixed by you specifically There are many times where by the time I get back to people they solved their own problem which makes you wonder Did I even need to be called in the first place   I dont know what to do This is my first IT job fresh out of college and while its been a MASSIVE learning experience that most guys fresh out of school wouldnt get to breathe near Active Directory server administration etc Im finally starting to crack    Breathe take a step back and think through priorities People will come to you freaking out about everything asif it is a P the most important thing in the world or must be fixed now because the world is ending and there isnt anything they can do about it Thats just how IT works sadly Ive been at it almost  years now and never had the fortune to walk into a work environment that is pristine Those kinds of environments are few and far between Once people know youre capable you become a goto until you start setting boundaries Youre one man    I dont know if a simple vacation day would help I have  days to use they dont roll over in the new year or if I need to start looking elsewhere for more pay to offset the stress   Take two days off and really think about this Dont stress out about it but really think about what youre going to gain if you leave where youre working now Do you like the people you work with How is the culture Whats the job market like Are you making market rate below or above that taking into consideration where you live Can you manage peoples expectations better How can you set boundaries that are both acceptable and beneficial to your mental health I have been working at my current gig for  years and there have been times when Ive considered leaving because of dumb shit happening I typically inventory why I havent left decide if that has changed look at the job market and go from there  I left aa VAR gig because I was benched for an entire summer got a new boss who refused to meet with me to go over my strengths wouldnt let me work on other engineering projects while we were waiting on a big contract to get kicked off and was generally a despondent individual The great thing was I could go to the pub every day to watch the World Cup The bad thing was Id show up to the office and work in the lab and work with some of my colleagues on other projects they were working on but never was on a project officially     Im not allowed to work from home ever   Ive found internal jobs almost never have WFH unless its late night work or really really bad weather WFH is more common for MSPVAR work contract work or larger companies that are trying to find work out of their home market I dont get to work from home either unless were doing late night work or weekend work which begs the question why do you allow this but not during office hours but I digress Its surprisingly normal for enterprise work   offset the stress  This is what you need to do going forward Take up a nontechnical hobby Fishing hunting hiking something that a local LGS runs on the regular anything that isnt in front of a computer For me that means my family cooking MTG and wrestling I have also been teaching myself html and nodejs too but thats because Ive always wanted to p

2020-07-01 07:24:28+00:00,Ok so it looks like youre interested in remote access VPN the ones connecting people from remote sites to your network like the ones used for WFH  At a high level the basic idea is   you set up clients on your laptops and whatsnot and a server at your company but exposed to the Internet reachable by remote people in I dont know Hawaii or Japan or Tokyo otherwise whats the point   Clients are configured to set up a connection to the public IP of that server   Once that connection is established possibly after checking things like a password a digital certificate on your PC the OS version to see if your PC is sufficiently secure your PC gets a private IP belonging to your network say  Typically this IP belongs to a specific pool of IPs reserved for VPN clients  From now on and while the  VPN connection is still up your PC acts as if it were on your physical corporate network So provided theres no blocking firewall rule for your particular IP or for the VPN clients IP pool everything should work as usual barring latency issues and so on  So generally speaking you need   clients and a way to distribute them maybe by hand maybe via software distribution   a publicfacing VPN server exposed on a specific port maybe  choosing random ports doesnt help much with security It has to be reachable from the Internet otherwise theres no point in all this This in turn requires  a a static IP  b likely a public DNS name  c if you use HTTPS and you probably should a valid HTTPS certificate browsers hate selfsigned  d firewall rules on your side allowing access to that IP on that port from any the Internet   Note that this publicfacing VPN server if not already integrated in some network appliance can be on prem if you have baremetal servers andor are willing to have one or not For example it could be something on the cloud However in that case you need additional firewall rules   something that carries out NAT network address translation Closely related to this you need a pool of IP addresses maybe specific for VPN clients from which you extract private IPs for your VPN clients This means proper DHCP configuration   because firewalls are default deny devices as in what you dont specifically allow is forbidden you need to ensure that pool of IP addresses is not blocked by any firewall rule or lack thereof  I say generally speaking because sometimes some of those functions are collapsed in a single devicesystem  Take at look at your Draytek documentation and see how much it does out of the box and how much you have to do with something else Then stop study how things work at a lower level SSL IPSec or gasp LTP Study NAT if you arent already familiar with it Only then you should give it a shot,"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988555908203125}",NEGATIVE,0.9988555908203125

2021-01-01 14:16:40+00:00,I work for an Ontario government Ministry  Our department is working more efficiently  based on our tracking metrics for requestsdeliverables we have handled a much higher volume with WfH This is probably because staff are available for longer hours our processes have not been impacted as our work has always been email based and meetings have been replaced with quick conference callsTeamsSkype etc Coincidentally before Covid hit we moved to an EApprovals system to track packages as they moved through the approval chain so this has made life easier too   We have more work as the boundaries between work and home life have blurred The pandemic has affected the operations of my ministry and we have a few new programsfunds available for the public to apply to so thats also meant more work as new policies and programs are developed and implemented   My division not the whole ministry had  dayweek WfH before Covid Full time WfH will NOT stay in the Ontario Public Service after Covid because Doug Ford tried to bring us back in the fall during the second wave but quickly abandoned that plan in November as cases were rising Our Deputy Ministers are also constantly reinforcing that we will return to office in all staff emails and town halls Only reason were going back is because the Cons think we can revive the downtown Toronto economy with our presence lol  yet the Cons are allowed to work remotely from Switzerland and St Barts lol  My manager and director are awesome they are not micromanaging at all But they were good leaders and managers before Covid and they supported our  dayweek WfH before Covid so they already knew how to deal with a remote workforce before   I also got my merit and inflation increase this year Our collective agreement expires March  so I suspect thats when the cuts will begin as the Cons will implement a new agreement As for promotions I know other colleagues who have applied to internal jobs in the Ontario government and have gotten new jobs during Covid  we have had an external hiring freeze for  years so theres lots of vacant roles,"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9929540753364563}",NEGATIVE,0.9929540753364563

2020-07-04 23:15:22+00:00,Its very hard out there  One reason is that everything has changed almost overnight Before ALL the highend editing was done in a shop setting where quality editors were valued certainly but were also in a real sense  seat fillers for larger operations This was the norm for production houses and TV stations  Sure some editors worked for years like that but increasingly over the past few decades  filling the  seats often meant more instability as an AVID editor might see a shop going to FCP Legacy or more recently Premiere  and the seat holder needing to decide whether to learn the new system or migrate from gig to gig as the shops technology changed   Then COVID hit  And nearly overnight the hot seat was WorkFromHome  Could you setup an efficient rig OUTSIDE the office where you could still deliver work and get paid for it  And thats still where we are today Some gigs are creeping back but as many probably never will   And thats the current editors challenge  Do you have access to a solid suite of editorial tools and the chops to drive them to solve content creation problems  If so youre probably still working and as busy as before Covid I know I am and its largely because I migrated to laptop editing years ago and created a superstable fiber internet connected home edit system that I built around my fascination with and migration to FCP X   But the software you use doesnt actually matter very much at all What matters is being able to control the end to end editorial process and remotely collaborate as needed without someone else opening up a building somewhere for you  Thats the new reality  A laptop and high speed Internet plus the skills to solve content creation problems whether those are logging AE work actual editing sound design graphic creation or whatever  those skills are more valuable than ever now  But you arent going to be simply filling a seat in someone elses shop and using their gear as much any more  in my opinion  Youll get paid because you have proved you can advance a project Likely using your own personal tools And where youre physically located is going to matter less and less   In my opinion thats going to be the new normal   Whats cool is that todays powerful and relatively inexpensive tools give EVERYONE a pretty equal shot at the jobs  The rest is up to you  Its the coming era of an editor being more and more like a musician  Sure some still hold seats in house bands  but more and more how much you work depends on your reputation contacts and how well you did the last time you landed a gig  Harsh reality But thats my crystal ball report  Good luck out there,"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9960379004478455}",NEGATIVE,0.9960379004478455

2020-07-13 11:17:27+00:00,OneCoin Reason for Cryptocurrency  Reason No   Banking The Unbanked  This is when I get very excited about OneCoin  Where most people looking at OneCoin get it wrong is that they try to guess the future price of the coin in terms of PRODUCTION DEMAND  They think in terms of how many other people will try to mineproduce coins forcing the price to go up The price of the coin is PRODUCTION PRICE  There is a flood of people wanting to mine OneCoin yet this is not the real price Its short term  You will always hear me talking of CUSTOMER DEMAND  Who will want to use OneCoin AS A CURRENCY Who is the end user Who will buy the OneCoins from the miners  What will the PUBLIC PRICE be  The key is understanding the size of the customer markets for cryptocurrency  As Dr Ruja explains the st and largest group is the Unbanked People who dont have access to banking services or the services are bad too expensive or ineffective Unbanked  Economically crippled  Attached is the article from which we get the Unbanked numbers used in the LATEST OneCoin presentation Its from the worlds leading strategic consultancy McKinsey And it says there are over  Billion Unbanked in the world  Reason No   Currency Creation  currency creates effective currency and for an effective banking system to work globally the world would need at least  of currency per person or  x billion   trillion  REMEMBER unlike fakefiat currency banksgovernments cant just print more currency it has to be mined  Makes sense  What this means is that the TOTAL market value for ALL cryptocurrencies in the world not just OneCoin used by this market group could eventually be  trillion Market Value  price of currencies x number of coins  ANDthis is just ONE of the THREE key markets for cryptocurrency  Do you understand why I see huge value potential in OneCoin  NOTE  My analysis is my personal opinion and not official opinion of OneCoin or Dr Ruja  Reason No   Protect Income  Wealth  The valuepower based in a Fiat Currency gets destroyed by inflation created by governments printing money Sometimes this inflation becomes hyperinflation  Venezuela has massive oil income and reserves Wealth means nothing if the government destroys your currency  The only credible currency that governments cannot destroy is cryptocurrency which is why the world needs a NEW GLOBAL RESERVE CURRENCY   A Trillion Dollar Opportunity  Only OneCoin has the strategy to achieve this and we are already rd of the way there No other crypto even has the plan to do this  This is why OneCoin will be the Facebook or Google the dominant global leader in a new digital area  moneypayment  Its why OneCoin is the biggest opportunity in the history of networking And its why I am involved with OneCoin What about you  You can join me,"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989763498306274}",NEGATIVE,0.9989763498306274

2020-07-14 22:00:13+00:00,Preface I have always been on the left Im essentially a democratic socialist I have always been one of those people who thinks the Democratic Party is essentially a centerright party and I supported Bernie Sanders in  and  Im not a Trump supporterRepublican and never will be and I think that Trump is as much to blame as the Democratic establishment for politicizing COVID and lockdowns and what have you I also think Trumps mismanagement of the virus is grotesquely incompetent yet I also believe that the USs lack of a social safety net and comprehensive social welfare system meant that any pandemic was going to wreck havoc  on not only the health system but the population as a whole hence why Im a lefty  That being said my moderate skepticism moderate because I supported the initial lockdown to flatten the curve because we didnt know much about the virus then and the US healthcare system is an absolute shitshow and in theory I would still support  week lockdowns if ICU capacity is reached but there needs to be some light at the end of the tunnelIm  opposed to indefinite lockdown about lockdowns stems exactly from my leftwing positions Im less concerned with muh economy and more concerned with the human price thats being paid from mental health to hunger to loss of income which okay I guess is the economy but it directly impacts peoples quality of life I couldnt care less about STONKS I have always struggled with mental health ever since I could remember Before COVID I was doing great I was in my first year of a new graduate program and doing quite well working hard etc but then COVID and lockdowns happened which has run roughshod over my mental health and has effectively ruined any progress I might have made over the past few years I feel utterly hopeless for the first time in a while and it doesnt feel good  Im also an avid travelertravel is one of my big hobbies and passions and I literally save up money so I can go on one big tripyear I was supposed to be in Europe right now  werent we all s  and the attitude towards travel especially international travel is driving me insane right now No Janice vacationing in Wisconsin or Arkansas is not the same as vacationing in Italy or Spain Im so sick of domestic travel being pushed as an alternative especially since any place Id want to visit within the US is closed right now and not worth visiting NYC DC Boston and Im not a fan of camping or anything having to do with nature the next person who tries to encourage me to make the best of quarantine by going fucking camping in a national park will get an earful In order to not make this year a complete wash travelwise Im looking at traveling later this year to one of the countries thats open to Americans since my college will be all online this fall so I can essentially take classes from anywhere but my God the pushback youll get if you even suggest that you are thinking about doing such a thing Youre selfish Youre gonna kill people Stay the f at home This even after I say that Ive been quarantined since it all began that I dont mind wearing a maskI dontand that Ill take all the necessary precautions while traveling etc What if travel in itself is essential for my mental wellbeingmental health Ive literally been trapped in my apartment in a city I hate since midMarch I need some hope some light at the end of the tunnel some promise of something good to redeem this shitty year in order to not completely lose it Is that a crime And this from the same people who claim to care so much about mental health  I also think the travel bans are bull because community transmission is a thing and even countries that have their borders completely closed are still having new cases so its not the foreigners who are bringing the virus in at this point Perhaps they couldve been helpful earlier on like in January but now I feel like its just a political game especially the EU travel banonce Trump lifts the ban on EU into the USand I hope he does this as I thought that decision was stupid and shortsighted as wellIm sure the EU will lift the ban on Americans  This gets me to another pointthe sheer amount of misinformation that is wielded for partisan purposes on both sides The oftrepeated meme of Mexico closed its borders to the US isnt entirely trueMexico closed its land border with the US Americans can still fly into Mexico with no problem People are astonished when I tell them this basic fact since its funnier or somehow more politically convenient to believe that Mexico built a wall to keep the diseased Americans out And dont get me started on that bs sensationalist Medium post about how the US passport is worthless now Newsflash MOST PASSPORTS ARE WORTHLESS NOW since most countries still have their borders closed to EVERYONE Yet people ate this shit up Were not gonna be able to travel until  please just shut the f up These are just a couple of examples of many but as an avid traveler I follow this stuff more closely than I do other topics related to the virus  Finally Ill end my rant by talking about the honestly twisted way that a lot of prolockdown types are trying to make lockdown into some twee quirky uwu look at me Im baking banana bread and drinking wine at  am quarantinelife workfromhome and of course theyre all well off privileged mostly white people remember this virus disproportionately affects POC because structural classrace inequality in the US is a thing Its honestly disgusting And yet people who claim to care about structural racism and inequality are eating this stuff up My entire family are antiTrump liberals which I generally have no issue with I hate Trump too but the way the media and the discourse in general has just completely broken their brains is justhard to believe We cant eat indoors now even at restaurants that have taken all the precautions in the world Theyre shaming me for flying even though I dont have a car and flying is the only way I can get home to them And apparently the solution to my mental health problems according to them is to work hard so Biden gets elected I was planning on voting for Biden anyway Thanks thats very helpful s Its either that or go on some domestic nature trip that I have never had any desire to go on since I couldnt go to Europe this summer Again not helpful  Im just hoping to get the f out of this craphole country USA as soon as I can because both sides here have completely lost their minds the MAGA types and these broken brain liberals Because I refuse to get stuck here again if theres another pandemic Screw that,"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992985129356384}",NEGATIVE,0.9992985129356384
