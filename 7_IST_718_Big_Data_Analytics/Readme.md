**1.Timeseries Analysis - PREDICTING HOME PRICES**

**Objective**

Warren Buffet said Real estate is an asset “for a great many people,” particularly for families that plan on being in the same location for many years. “If you know you’re going to live in a given area or think it’s very likely, for a considerable period of time, and you’ve got a family, the home is terrific.”

We don’t have to emphasize how important a house plays in our life. In this analysis will use the past historical house prices to answer the business questions on where to invest for the Syracuse Real Estate Investment Trust (SREIT).
