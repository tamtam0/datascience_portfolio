to this  Id signed on for Technical Writing after the military Navy submariner and I was surprised at how much Id retained  Id worked on several manuals for different projects for the military aviation avionics manuals a sorting machine for the USPS and many manuals for my current position with a semiconductor company  It is a six figure job BUT you have to understand that you are almost always looked at as a necessary evil  Documenting something is usually not looked at as something as fun or rewarding as designing a product or getting it to come to life according to the idea or vision  No specific college experience  It does allow WFH  My first year at this location had me doing all work via Email  xB  If youre single and willing to move to wherever the work is as a contractor youll never be out of work for long  It actually helps your growth as a writer because you start to understand the different tools and methods used to perform the job,POSITIVE

Hmm so Ive been working in the loop now for over  years yikes I was living in the city when I staggered then married had a kid moved out to the burbs and suddenly found myself commuting  hours a day   About a year ago give or take I asked to move to a closer office Found out all the corporate BS that is involved in moving and decided it wasnt going to be the hill I die on The commute was terrible just that eliminating it would have been nice so I could do other things   When March rolled around we didnt know how long the lockdown would last  weeks amirite and I didnt think much of it We cleaned up our basement and put together our elliptical and I managed to carve out some space that I call my office Its not the greatest spot but it works and I have enough room to work   About a month into the lockdown I found that I needed to workout a little more So I started riding more  over the summer I was riding  miles a day Yikes In any other summer Id be riding maybe  miles all summer and I was doing that in a week  Weve also picked up a Peloton and been using our elliptical as well   One big reason I wanted to work closer to home was because I didnt interact with a lot of people in my local office I found myself commuting all the way into the loop to sit on phone calls with people across the US Now Im doing the same thing from home   Im really OK with the setup Im extroverted so Ive found that talking on the phone just  soothes me Ive kept in touch with a LOT more people than I normally would have I text we setup phone chats mostly during the day  I do miss leaving my office desk and getting that fresh coffee with a friend or former coworker I dont miss paying almost  a month to commute to my job I dont miss paying  a month in dry cleaning I also dont miss how fucking loud my office could get with that open office plan god I hope that never sees the light of day again   Im super lucky though My wife has been WFH since my first kid was born and has been able to manage her work and the kids school I dont dabble in any of that stuff and Im incredibly thankful for that   I feel like Ive written a novel here Bottom line  Im OK with my setup as it is I dont have to ever go back to an office Even though every day is exciting Im closer to the end of my career than I am to the beginning I hope though I wouldnt mind working for  years and I dont need to make face to face connections like my younger colleagues do,POSITIVE

Not petty but I want to vent I accepted a job about  months ago its extremely well paid and its a very very big company that you definitely have heard of  One of my biggest issues that I made very clear upfront was that I would need to have at least some recurring work from home once I got up to speed My commute is anywhere from  to  hours each way Its insane But yeah like I said the job pays the bucks  So I had some time off and my boss tells me to think about what day I want to work from home and we can start when I come back I come back say hey boss I think Fridays are the day Ill work from home And she says oh no you didnt hear No recurring work from home anymore for anyone in this division VP said so  Like dude Both you and the VP personally interviewed me and understood how horrible the commute would be and agreed we could do this Can you not go to bat for me on this Come on I said to her this is a big problem for me I was really counting on that WFH Ok she says shell talk to the VP Never happened That was  months ago   Now I have to give my notice on Monday I found a job that pays even more thats more aligned with what I enjoy about my career Im a SQL dev and is less than half the distance and probably close to rd the commute So even if they said no dont go you can work from home Its too late That ship has sailed,NEGATIVE

I bet youre correct That being said  I am WFH on a permanent basis and had been working towards that before covid was a thing I have several friends in a similar boat  So in my little anecdotal world  I know more antilockdown work from homers than prolockdown ones  I agree people doing that are hypocrites but when the backlash comes against the WFH crowd and i do see it coming I see more harm piled on to my family WFH was something I had already negotiated because we were in a bad spot and it allowed me to allow my wife to work by me watching the kids at the right time during the day  WFH has both played a role in helping my daughters health problems and gotten us out of dire financial straights by removing an impossible timing conflict      Another anecdote  My coworkers child has FoxG and he had an hour commute WorkFromHome allowed him to share more of the burden with his wife In fact it was his problem that opened  my oppurtunity Both of us are severely antilockdown Its prevented his child from getting the necessary treatments and prevented mine from getting a diagnosis Took months to get a GI visit Ive been lockdown skeptical from the beginning because Im one of those asshole libertarians that doesnt trust the gov by default,NEGATIVE

She should really talk to her MS doc about how other coronaviruses this isnt the only one interact with MS Any sort of illness as I understand it can cause a flare or even a decline in condition with MS Its such a fickle disease that its hard to know what will and wont be bad I know the flu is a bozonono for MS patients They are months getting over it and their normal energy levels which by most standards and experiences are low are even more low  I think social distancing is probably a good idea if only because your mom is at risk I also think its a great time for HR to send out a note saying Hey We dont come to work when were sick And if a family member is sick we also dont come to work Make sure you have the ability to work from home if you need to and remember we all have PFML if we need it  Personally Im handwashing like a mad woman and taking my normal The flu sucks so lets not share it precautions Ive been a teacher for  years so infectious disease is part of the job as is slowing spread whenever possible I really hope this is a wakeup call to the American Public that going to school or work during illness is REALLY BAD for all of us and it needs to stop We need better systems and workplaces to deal with the idea that people can and should stay home when theyre ill  When Im in classrooms I avoid all sorts of touching including handshakes and high fives if at all possible between about October and April And I wash my hands as often as I can I dont believe in performative stuff like wearing a mask if youre healthy or using hand sanitizer which is an unpopular opinion Many of the versions out there are not strong enough and just build stronger and better germs Thats the last thing we need out of this virus I do believe in Lysoling my doorknobs keyboard mouse and phone on a regular basis and not sharing if we can avoid it We also have a full WFH plan that we can execute at the drop of a hat thanks to the snowstorm last year Im not in full time teaching anymore but Im in charge of making sure my office can function no matter what the situation   The Post is reporting that weve had it circulating for  weeks in the community This is here and LOTS of folks are carrying it if the information is correct Nobody knows the shed pattern and lots of people are mistaking it for a cold,NEGATIVE

everyone is suddenly stuck at home  with the only thing there is to do being work  This is a pretty bad faith take right here The way I see it your experience with work from home is heavily based on your ability to compartmentalize between work time and offwork time Back when we all worked at the office there was a distinct physical separation between work and home marked by a daily commute so most people were able to easily separate their work life from their home life Obviously we dont have that for the time being  One important aspect of WFH Ive learned is that you have to make a real effort to separate work time from your personal time Failing that you easily run the risk of your work life bleeding into everything else which fucking sucks but for the most part it falls into the realm of personal responsibility YOU are the one responsible for making sure you clock out at pm and stop any work youre doing YOU are the one responsible for specifically carving out time for the activities you wish to enjoy outside of work There isnt a bus schedule or daily gym routine to demark your hours anymore so you have to man up and do the exceedingly difficult task of taking control of your own life Yes evidently that seems like a really difficult thing to do for some people But at the end of the day youre working from home Nobody is peeking at you through your webcam forcing you to work beyond the hours you feel reasonable to get your work done Nobody is expecting you to trade off the convenience of working from home for more hours of work Ultimately its on you to make sure youre not feeling burnt out and that involves everything from compartmentalizing your daily schedule to communicating with your manager if youre feeling overwhelmed   I work at the one FAANG company people on this sub love to shit on for shitty WLB yet most of my teammates still get off around  every day and I dont get bothered with work stuff at all after I get off But thats because they know as well as anyone else that work is just work Its not everything Even if youre on a team where nobody has a sense of boundaries when it comes to work you still owe it to yourself to enforce those boundaries and demand respect for your time I know that people feel the pressure to perform well and all that but if your life falls into disarray because youre working from home who else do you have to blame but yourself,NEGATIVE

Preface I have always been on the left Im essentially a democratic socialist I have always been one of those people who thinks the Democratic Party is essentially a centerright party and I supported Bernie Sanders in  and  Im not a Trump supporterRepublican and never will be and I think that Trump is as much to blame as the Democratic establishment for politicizing COVID and lockdowns and what have you I also think Trumps mismanagement of the virus is grotesquely incompetent yet I also believe that the USs lack of a social safety net and comprehensive social welfare system meant that any pandemic was going to wreck havoc  on not only the health system but the population as a whole hence why Im a lefty  That being said my moderate skepticism moderate because I supported the initial lockdown to flatten the curve because we didnt know much about the virus then and the US healthcare system is an absolute shitshow and in theory I would still support  week lockdowns if ICU capacity is reached but there needs to be some light at the end of the tunnelIm  opposed to indefinite lockdown about lockdowns stems exactly from my leftwing positions Im less concerned with muh economy and more concerned with the human price thats being paid from mental health to hunger to loss of income which okay I guess is the economy but it directly impacts peoples quality of life I couldnt care less about STONKS I have always struggled with mental health ever since I could remember Before COVID I was doing great I was in my first year of a new graduate program and doing quite well working hard etc but then COVID and lockdowns happened which has run roughshod over my mental health and has effectively ruined any progress I might have made over the past few years I feel utterly hopeless for the first time in a while and it doesnt feel good  Im also an avid travelertravel is one of my big hobbies and passions and I literally save up money so I can go on one big tripyear I was supposed to be in Europe right now  werent we all s  and the attitude towards travel especially international travel is driving me insane right now No Janice vacationing in Wisconsin or Arkansas is not the same as vacationing in Italy or Spain Im so sick of domestic travel being pushed as an alternative especially since any place Id want to visit within the US is closed right now and not worth visiting NYC DC Boston and Im not a fan of camping or anything having to do with nature the next person who tries to encourage me to make the best of quarantine by going fucking camping in a national park will get an earful In order to not make this year a complete wash travelwise Im looking at traveling later this year to one of the countries thats open to Americans since my college will be all online this fall so I can essentially take classes from anywhere but my God the pushback youll get if you even suggest that you are thinking about doing such a thing Youre selfish Youre gonna kill people Stay the f at home This even after I say that Ive been quarantined since it all began that I dont mind wearing a maskI dontand that Ill take all the necessary precautions while traveling etc What if travel in itself is essential for my mental wellbeingmental health Ive literally been trapped in my apartment in a city I hate since midMarch I need some hope some light at the end of the tunnel some promise of something good to redeem this shitty year in order to not completely lose it Is that a crime And this from the same people who claim to care so much about mental health  I also think the travel bans are bull because community transmission is a thing and even countries that have their borders completely closed are still having new cases so its not the foreigners who are bringing the virus in at this point Perhaps they couldve been helpful earlier on like in January but now I feel like its just a political game especially the EU travel banonce Trump lifts the ban on EU into the USand I hope he does this as I thought that decision was stupid and shortsighted as wellIm sure the EU will lift the ban on Americans  This gets me to another pointthe sheer amount of misinformation that is wielded for partisan purposes on both sides The oftrepeated meme of Mexico closed its borders to the US isnt entirely trueMexico closed its land border with the US Americans can still fly into Mexico with no problem People are astonished when I tell them this basic fact since its funnier or somehow more politically convenient to believe that Mexico built a wall to keep the diseased Americans out And dont get me started on that bs sensationalist Medium post about how the US passport is worthless now Newsflash MOST PASSPORTS ARE WORTHLESS NOW since most countries still have their borders closed to EVERYONE Yet people ate this shit up Were not gonna be able to travel until  please just shut the f up These are just a couple of examples of many but as an avid traveler I follow this stuff more closely than I do other topics related to the virus  Finally Ill end my rant by talking about the honestly twisted way that a lot of prolockdown types are trying to make lockdown into some twee quirky uwu look at me Im baking banana bread and drinking wine at  am quarantinelife workfromhome and of course theyre all well off privileged mostly white people remember this virus disproportionately affects POC because structural classrace inequality in the US is a thing Its honestly disgusting And yet people who claim to care about structural racism and inequality are eating this stuff up My entire family are antiTrump liberals which I generally have no issue with I hate Trump too but the way the media and the discourse in general has just completely broken their brains is justhard to believe We cant eat indoors now even at restaurants that have taken all the precautions in the world Theyre shaming me for flying even though I dont have a car and flying is the only way I can get home to them And apparently the solution to my mental health problems according to them is to work hard so Biden gets elected I was planning on voting for Biden anyway Thanks thats very helpful s Its either that or go on some domestic nature trip that I have never had any desire to go on since I couldnt go to Europe this summer Again not helpful  Im just hoping to get the f out of this craphole country USA as soon as I can because both sides here have completely lost their minds the MAGA types and these broken brain liberals Because I refuse to get stuck here again if theres another pandemic Screw that,NEGATIVE

PMs and management dgaf about that  So we agree they shouldnt use those metrics    If that person is getting as much done as the person who is a dumbass for  hoursday  Annnd its like the above never happened Getting as much done begs the question of having a good metric which we seem to agree is difficult to formulate    onceyear during his performance review  Do you have team retros every sprint  Or regular  with your manager  You have another issue here not related to WFH but its really getting out of bounds for the topicthread    Who cares  Well you should here it seems to be creating problems for you  You quickly forget your own problems in immediately adjacent paragraphs in the same post   From my perspective this is very odd   If you see someone who is through whatever means not deemed productive screwing off in whatever way you can give them very specific and actionable feedback  We need you to take shorter breaks  I see you taking  hours away from your desk and not meetings per day and it seems to impact your productivity    Some people need coaching  In another post someone mentions bad employee but people can be helped and developed if you can provide specific feedback about their work habits  I really dont like the goodbad employee dichotomy it is rather hopeless and I dont feel reflective of most actual humans     I should add that IMO WFH should be commonplace as a privilege for responsible productive employees I dont think it should be readily available for those who struggle to be productive while working from home  Do you think managers should revoke it for specific employees  Interesting idea but I imagine a lot of problems here Seems like a vector for discrimination claims A company would have to be very careful about things like this,NEGATIVE

I suspect its a combination of presenteeism and tracking issues  Worked hours are really easy to track And higher numbers are obviously more better right Productivity for a certain job meanwhile is more difficult  not difficult absolutely but more difficult relatively  to track Youd need some kind of framework that can quantify the productivity and the more complex the job or the more readily changing the harder this becomes  Working from home also ties into this if you can measure productivity and not hours it becomes easier to justify working from home The benefits of normalising WFH would be potentially massive if we can pull it off Childcare costs rush hour traffic office space rents workplace harassment and general stress should all go down while free time goes up because the commute is removed Might suck for suit manufacturers as you can now work in your underwear though just er not on skype calls,NEGATIVE

Or make remote learning more of a thing for schools other than university Even just a rotation so not all kids are in class at the same time   And make the social bubble for kids actually a bubble What theyre doing now grouping all kids of one age group as a bubble and not accounting for siblings is a recipe for disaster Which the high infection rate has proven to be true   Yes it wont be easy for parents but this is where the government comes in Make WFH more prominent again add rights to parents if possible to request to WFH so they can supervise kids when theyre on the at home rotation For parents who cant WFH have schools work with the parents so maybe a buddy system can be in place for that class Ie parent cant WFH pair their child up with a child whos parents can and lives close enough for the child to visit The children are in the same bubble anyway but itd lower the potential infection rate   Finally IF a parent would be able to supervise their children allow the parent to opt in to  remote learning   Yes this isnt perfect but its something at least as opposed to whatever logic was applied to this governments decision,NEGATIVE

The trouble is that they make it very easy for reasonable sounding politicians and media personalities to dismiss them as extremists   Look at these dickheads if this is how they protest their concerns are probably bollocks too goes the argument Then you get Boris saying XR should be jumping for joy at what his government are doing about climate change and whether its true or not a certain demographic sees that response as reasonable and sensible by default simply because its the conservative government saying it not the loony left   Cognitive dissonance holds that aggressively confronting peoples views on climate change wont cause them to have an epiphany it will simply make them more entrenched in their views and likely to back more extreme clampdown measures    You might not like it there might be less social media karma farming photo opportunities in it but XR would be better off now targeting specific policies and trying to feed into the policy making process This is a big opportunity for them right now with the talk of increased WFH and therefore probably increased capacity on existing public transport reduced flights etc   There probably was a case initially for them to raise their media profile with these stunts but they should now be looking to feed into the conversation with specific ideas about what government can now do to legislate new ways to help ordinary people use their cars less buy local and think more about flying for pleasure the pandemic is surely a gift especially for the latter one I believe Sunak is already talking about increasing fuel tax for example would a bit of credit where credits due help whilst also using that as a springboard for a conversation about letting peoole who can WFH do so and bring others onto the freed up capacity on public transport   Instead it feels like this is falling into the same preaching to the converted feedback loop as Remain WFH evangelism and climate issues in general Ie something seen as a middle class concern that doesnt reflect the realities of life in this country for most people I cant see these latest protests doing anything to dispel that notion,NEGATIVE

OneCoin Reason for Cryptocurrency  Reason No   Banking The Unbanked  This is when I get very excited about OneCoin  Where most people looking at OneCoin get it wrong is that they try to guess the future price of the coin in terms of PRODUCTION DEMAND  They think in terms of how many other people will try to mineproduce coins forcing the price to go up The price of the coin is PRODUCTION PRICE  There is a flood of people wanting to mine OneCoin yet this is not the real price Its short term  You will always hear me talking of CUSTOMER DEMAND  Who will want to use OneCoin AS A CURRENCY Who is the end user Who will buy the OneCoins from the miners  What will the PUBLIC PRICE be  The key is understanding the size of the customer markets for cryptocurrency  As Dr Ruja explains the st and largest group is the Unbanked People who dont have access to banking services or the services are bad too expensive or ineffective Unbanked  Economically crippled  Attached is the article from which we get the Unbanked numbers used in the LATEST OneCoin presentation Its from the worlds leading strategic consultancy McKinsey And it says there are over  Billion Unbanked in the world  Reason No   Currency Creation  currency creates effective currency and for an effective banking system to work globally the world would need at least  of currency per person or  x billion   trillion  REMEMBER unlike fakefiat currency banksgovernments cant just print more currency it has to be mined  Makes sense  What this means is that the TOTAL market value for ALL cryptocurrencies in the world not just OneCoin used by this market group could eventually be  trillion Market Value  price of currencies x number of coins  ANDthis is just ONE of the THREE key markets for cryptocurrency  Do you understand why I see huge value potential in OneCoin  NOTE  My analysis is my personal opinion and not official opinion of OneCoin or Dr Ruja  Reason No   Protect Income  Wealth  The valuepower based in a Fiat Currency gets destroyed by inflation created by governments printing money Sometimes this inflation becomes hyperinflation  Venezuela has massive oil income and reserves Wealth means nothing if the government destroys your currency  The only credible currency that governments cannot destroy is cryptocurrency which is why the world needs a NEW GLOBAL RESERVE CURRENCY   A Trillion Dollar Opportunity  Only OneCoin has the strategy to achieve this and we are already rd of the way there No other crypto even has the plan to do this  This is why OneCoin will be the Facebook or Google the dominant global leader in a new digital area  moneypayment  Its why OneCoin is the biggest opportunity in the history of networking And its why I am involved with OneCoin What about you  You can join me,NEGATIVE

WFH Day 86 If Youre Reading This Its Too Late by Drake  Perry Hall Maryland,NEGATIVE
While this opinion piece is devoid of any real research I suspect there is a point on the effect on workers  Dont get me wrong I absolutely love mostlyWfH I particurly like the assurance of not being sent to client sites at the arse end of the country for weeks at a time  But getting companies used to hiring nationwide just means there will likely be a downward pressure on salaries as it would be expected that people will attempt to minimise their costs by moving to low CoL areas And much of the economy is fueled by the admittedly toxic and backwards requirement to travel to city centres for work  If as the author alludes to companies switch to a mostly contractorfreelance workforce then professionals can expect work to become a lot more tenuous Super flexible sure but also with no assurance over level of income etc and a lot of admin overhead Though one could opt for a consultancy instead  Though I am less sure about the outsourcing of people beyond our shores There is a lot of good reasons to outsource but there are many more to keep locally I doubt there would be much motivation to change between a remote British worker and a foreign one Hell if thats happening here if the coming recession signifficantly lowers our salaries then suddenly remote British workers can be hired by other firms throughout the world due to our low costs Places where salaries are high like the US Australia etc though Im surprised this hasnt happened already  But like the title There is going to be a cost to this like it or not It is whether the macroeconomic effects are worth the benefit,NEGATIVE

No I hated it I WFH anyway so that didnt change for me business as usual It sucked majorly for many reasons and felt like a claustrophobic prison   I had to work but couldnt do any of the fun nice things I like meeting friends for coffee going to the cinema picking out library books in the library   I live in another county compared to my family like a good few people which meant I had very little support from my mother except for phone as Im currently  months pregnant today which leads me to my next point   My pregnancy which is very wanted was something a long time coming My first over a decade ago was awful as I was so young I powered through to get it done and the labour was traumatic due to the behaviour and attitude of the staff am older now so defo wont be happening this time This was meant to be my do over Guess what It isnt No meeting mommy groups no pregnancy yoga my SO cant come to my apps and missed all the scans and gender scan and other nice things I have severe backpelvic pain and got sent to a physio in March and was told to wear this belt which doesnt work btw and or take pain killers I couldnt organise my own physio because of Covid so I just had to suck it up and live with the fact that turning sitting standing sleeping is just gonna be shit for me til I at least give birth   Its now July st and Im STILL living in an uncertain medical period My hospital antenatal classes have been cancelled for the st  weeks in August WTF and will be rescheduled however Ill be induced between th and th so when I cant get a class in person even one to one and Im not paying  or so for a video chat   My SO still isnt allowed to attend apps with me and no one knows when he will be allowed so all in all hes seen our son a grand total of twice when he was this weird alien shape and no one can tell me if hell be allowed to attend the birth as normal or is it the same rules as currently in place he must wait outside in the car until Im actively pushing then he can come in stay for an hour or  after the birth and he has to piss off then and Im alone again   So no I ducking hate this Its not just the social isolation its the thought of quite possibly going through what I know will be a painful and traumatic experience with very little support from a loved one And no I know Im not going to be special plenty of women doing it right now but that doesnt change the anxiety and stress that I fee over it The disappointment Ive had two shitty disappointing pregnancies and that there wont be a third And please do not say any platitudes like at least the baby is okhealthy or you can join online groups or insert other negating sentence here Ive heard them all Ive thought them all It doesnt change the fact my do over has not been the nice fun enjoyable experience women talk about and get  rant,NEGATIVE

oldschool politics that require us to be in our seats from  every day when in reality we could do our jobs from anywhere   xB  I think this is very telling of any workplace  In the absence of any other evidence to the contrary this kind of mentality tells me that the bosses care more about the perception of work than the production of work Letting people have WFH days is a huge morale booster shows trust and recognizes employees as people rather than assets   IMHO a company that cares more about perception than production is the exact kind of company that shows the least amount of loyalty and empathy for their employees  again barring the absence of other evidence to the contrary   xB  That being said I dont think you should let your feelings cloud your judgement here you sought out other opportunities for a reason and you demonstrated value such that multiple companies with better working conditions compensation and benefits have shown interest in you    xB  Take the job Youve earned it    xB  The easiest way to give your resignation is to send a very short matteroffact email to the management team that youre leaving on suchandsuch date,NEGATIVE

Regarding the Seems to be some doublethink going on here part  I think the answer is much simpler people are different and respond differently to WFH depending on their personality work habits role company commute and home vs office situation   Some people are really thriving right now and others are suffering If you work in a very collaborative role eg audit everything is harder now If you are in a more independent role things are way easier If you struggle with the lack of mental separation between work and home due to the lack of physical separation I have always been someone who works at work and studies late into the night at school while home is for relaxing then WFH has been a disaster for you Some people are also very stressed out about the interruptions to their daily lives and the fear of getting sick or getting laid off I struggle with all three I miss my daily routines I have an underlying medical condition and  of my company has already been laid off while others are better able to cope  People are different and what works for one person wont always work for another Its really not rocket science,NEGATIVE

Sounds like a big school There are a lot restrictions to zoom calls In a classroom the kids actually have to do something rather than just sit and listen For example for my son he had to write a  sentence story about the national flag For the more advanced kids the teacher will give something extra to keep them occupied Another reason that the teacher only gave a simple reading homework is probably to lessen the burden of the parents My son were given homework and I was juggling between completing my WFH projects and keeping up with all of his tasks in Google ClassroomI ended up skipping on a lot  Im not sure how it is in the US but here we can see the curriculum in Grade  So our education goal is for him to to at least reach the basics of that Grade  Then we focus on interest based activities that might not be taught in school right now but good for general knowledge like cooking how our body works planets dinosaurs etc Knowledge is limitless and its not just focused on reading or maths,NEGATIVE

mondaydotcom MarketingProfs sharlyn_lauby This week I learned that MarketingProfs is a tiny house We demand pictures,NEGATIVE
In my current company its completely dependent on the position but overall unremarkable  Some of our positions are fully remote and most managers trust that anyone who makes it through the hiring process is skilled enough and trustworthy enough to work from home  Of course there are some positions that have to be on site and some managers who probably prefer to have more facetoface time in the beginning but the overall sentiment is youre a grownup just get your work done  Im in MA but our company is global  This has been true of positions I have held in large global F companies  We are currently back in the office at the levels allowed by our state which is  capacity  We have scheduled days in and out of the office usually  days in every other week and the rest of the time at home  No idea when that will change as it depends on the government mandates  In the position I had before this it was the complete opposite  My manager placed a ridiculous amount of importance on butts in seats timeto the point where if someone had to leave  minutes early for a doctors appointment or something she expected them to make up that  minutes during the week despite us being salaried nonexempt and not in positions where we had to staff a reception desk or phones or anything  Its one of the reasons why I left in fact  First of all theres nothing magical about my office that makes me more productive all other things being equal  I mean if we have roofers reshingling our house on any given day of course being in the office would be better  By the same token if I throw out my back Ill be more productive at home where I can wear comfortable clothes and use an ice pack  But it also was indicative of a level of micromanaging that came through in other ways  The one thing I will say is that when I am hiring people who ask right away for anything different from how the job is presented are going to stand out in a bad way  Also some people preCovid would look for WFH positions to make up for not having childcare and thats not how this works Every company I have worked for has very clearly laid out that people who WFH must have child care in place Again Covid has changed this significantly,NEGATIVE

Same boat sis Yes yes I know Im fortunate and I do practice gratitude for the facts that I am young healthy and privileged enough to be able to WFH and that my older relatives elsewhere are getting their vax and will be safer   But   It is just so infuriating to be at the back of the line endlessly following all the recommendations to keep everyone else safer while so many in my dumb red state not only flout all health guidelines but fight tooth and nail to get mask mandates removed open up schools refuse to mask in stores are proud of holding huge dinner parties to own the libs etc Its just exhausting levels of stupid   Its so defeating And I think in the back of my mind I have this fear that even though the cavalry is coming we can see the light at the end of this tunnel and Ive been so careful for so long someone has to be the last casualty And the longer this drags on the more it feels like after all this the dumb cruel senseless end of the story would just be ironically perfect if I end up dying now so close to the finish line after having done everything right and waited patiently while the idiots around me who DGAF just got lucky to live unscathed by their own arrogant selfish idiocy   I feel you Rage on,NEGATIVE

I dreamt the universe ended Like full on ended There was nothing  It started out with just people waiting watching time go by as the moment arrived Then all of a sudden everything I could see fell away out of sight into pitch black accompanied by a low rumbling noise that ended in near silence Kind of like when youre on an airplane and your ears dont pop straight away   Next my feeling of self disappeared You know how if you close your eyes you can kind of sensesee where your limbs are  well that no longer existed This caused a massive feeling of terror and doom which I still felt when I woke up but then pure bliss I had no thoughts no feelings it was just nothing Ive never experienced calm like it Absolutely  stimulus No heat no sound no body no thoughts Nothing  Once I awoke I was a mess I couldnt think straight all thoughts led to that moment of nothingness I could barely do my workthankfully WFH so it wasnt immediately obvious And I now a week later can still vividly remember the dream like I just woke up   Obviously I  dont want the universe to end but I dont think Ill ever forget that feeling I got Part of me wants to dream of it again just to experience it once more,NEGATIVE

Whenever Im comparing salary between two cities I follow a very similar calculation to you   I take the base pay and enter it into a spread sheet well adjust for stockbonuses later  Find out taxes social security pretax contributions benefits et c to find out the net pay for both jobs  I spend a little bit finding potential places to rent to get an idea of rent will cost me for my situation COL calculators and adjustments found online will not always paint a true picture of the situation at hand For example in Seattle you might expect rent to be between kk for a one bedroom apartment but thats only really downtown and for luxury apartments If you adjust for your standards you might find something cheaper with a longer commute  Take the rent into consideration to figure out my monthly takehome  Calculate city specific spending living in a HCOL bump up monthly food budget travel costs random expenditures they add up quick and opportunities come around a lot more often in HCOL areas Figure out your final food budget what your utilities will cost and how much wiggle room you want to give that budget I always add a  bump just to be safe on total expenditures  Figure out what your monthly net savings is after rent utilities food monthly expenditures  Then I extrapolate out the net savings for    years assuming no raise at either job adding in moving bonus signing bonuses and stock offered for the position  Assume the worst case scenario at all steps that you wont get a raise that moving will cost more than expected and that you wont find a cheap place to rent You want a clear idea of where the job will take you and after youre left with a few years of savings projections for the job you can then start factoring in other benefits such as vacation remoteWFH flexibility job growth etc Also a good idea to track and extrapolate out k contributions from both jobs as well You can assume a compounding interest on savings as well  Looking at  saved is a bit misleading but also can help you get an idea of your stability in case of layoff Its much more manageable to deal with not having a job if your rent was  of your takehome pay versus if its  but at the same time you might have saved considerably more at the job where rent is much higher,NEGATIVE

TGIF  Ready for the week to be done Yesterday was a better day overall once I made it to work due to the storm Had I not royally screwed up the day before it would have been a work from home sort of day Apparently next week we are getting a huge storm Tuesday  during the day another  overnight and more Wednesday morning which sucks because obviously Id work from home that day but  I was already planning on asking about WFH on WednesdayFriday because of Bentos surgery Its hard to be asking for so much when the year barely begun Im nervous to ask new boss about this and kind of want to put it off until Monday but I know Ill be stressed about it all weekend too   Last night I did groceries while the BF cooked dinner Dont do groceries when you are hungry you will buy way more things than you need Such as enlightened caramel oatmeal cookie crunch ice cream This one is a winner Honestly Im having a hard time going back to Halo top after trying enlightened I just wish I found it at more stores than this one grocery story I visit maybe once a month I also won big with my steak choice Sometimes I find a cut that I think looks good bring it home and my bf will tell me I did bad since he is a meat cutter he is a bit of a snob lol I bought a porterhouse steak which I NEVER really eat and it just had the most perfect marbling and just looked amazing It was also like  marked down to  Ummm yes please The bf said I picked an amazing steak and was quite impressed Though I am that oddball that enjoys the new york strip part way more than the filet XD   Yoga didnt happen Ill be honest I just forgot But THIS WEEKEND Im gonna do all the things I have to I like yoga Ive been looking forward to this challenge so why is it so hard to start  I finally watched the new Black Mirror interactive movie Wow what a ride that was Black Mirror is one of my top TV shows and if you arent watching you should be just dont judge it off episode  lol The movie was great not as good at the show but it was such a unique experience Its a choose your own adventure movie so you literally pick what the character has to do in the movie I replayed it enough to get all  endings but one storyline had a character appear that I answered safe I wanted to go back and redo that part and see what the reaction would be but I couldnt make it happen again In my quest to get to that storyline again I discovered even more things The actual movie is like an hour and a half but there is I think abut  hours of actual content if you go through it all which is like a season of black mirror I have to say that this one was quite impactful though with IMO the happy ending being incredibly tragic yet somehow peaceful It took me forever to get that one to play out properly though Give it a go its great     Also Ive been playing the new switch pokemon game The bf got it for his birthday but Ive been the one playing it I love it Pokemon yellow has always been my favorite and this is essentially a remastered yellow where wild enounters are dumbed down tall grass you can see the pokemon and you can have  pokemon pikachu and anyne in your party follow you Currently riding a Persian D Its great fun and super relaxing   Oh and one more thing apparently Im going to Disney again for one day when I go on my truncated visit to Florida in March Im overlapping with my sisters vacation and she sent a group text last night asking which park we want to do on the day we planned on meeting up I think we are doing Animal Kingdom so that will be fun  Alrighty so I tried to leave some of the gloom out of this post ready to get out of this slump Puppy playtime tonight hopefully and a weekend that is mostly open Have a good Friday everyone,NEGATIVE

I mean it was great when we first switched and I had an awesome manager and director I essentially had the same PTO as the guy with  years at the company plus many before at places in the industry Come to think of it with the good manager I could basically work from home whenever I wanted unless there was some rare thing that needed my physical presence happening that day Just an event on a shared calendar in the morning saying you were WFH and having your home number in the meeting info or noting that you had your office phone forwarded And saying I have an errand I need to run at  and will be out of the office for an hour was totally acceptable as long as the team knew it at the beginning of the day So pretty close to what youre describing   BUT you have to have a reasonable management chain or youll take a real hit in performance reviews for taking off more than mandatory holidays and maybe a week   Not a team player  Doesnt contribute to team efficiency  When I saw it happen to a fellow employee the first time it made my blood boil When I later realized it was starting to happen to me after being involuntarily transferred to a different part of the organization my blood had completely converted to steam and was venting from around my eyes and ears like a tea kettle Screw unlimited PTO or flexible vacation time or any other system that a terrible manager can abuse so easily  So it isnt necessarily bad for you today but eventually it will always be less beneficial for the employees either because of bad management or because you arent banking all the PTO that you arent using I guess my warning is that it can all change and you hang on to that good manager as long as you can Dont make the mistake I did in letting myself go this is crap but the company has been good to me in the past and thinking that higher management will realize the problem and change it and you just need to hold out If the good manager or the good director I had gave a call saying that they thought they had a position for me wherever they are now I might well move to the middle of nowhere North Dakota No offense to ND but you guys have a lot of remote low population wilderness and I cant think of any extended family or former coworkersclassmates anywhere near ND and I needed an example of this is socially isolating but Id still do it to work for these people,NEGATIVE

People who are ahead may not be ahead be of their merits some might like I know people who are in the engineering field and making bank I did not do engineering and wish I had considered it   I also know people who are in top level jobs but only are there because of nepotism   And I know lots of people like I mean hundreds of people with degrees who are in dead end jobs   Reality is there is more of those jobs available They are the bottom of the pyramid and it sucks spending a fortune on education getting masters or Bachelors only to spend all that time and still end up in a job that you could have got without all that time and effort   But the thing is you have options even though there is more competition for jobs that are better you still have the qualifications to apply for them You still can do it   My partner was working in bars for over a decade and he got out of it a couple years ago at  Hes now working his dream job AND hes killing it Hes getting raises and appreciated for all his efforts   It will happen for you as long as you dont give up  Im in the same position as you  Its hard working a dead end job wasting your life away not getting the pay you are worth  Im also applying to everything but the pay is shit the only jobs getting back to me are the same dead end jobs I have been applying as the offer wfh but they are not even worth that  and all the jobs in my field that Im qualified for are just not getting back to me  Its a real dream killer but the reality is the market is even more saturated All nonessential businesses are closed now so anytime Im applying to a job in my field that I only have experience as a freelancer  has lead and senior people in that field applying too as they are all stuck at home All the layoffs companies made to stay afloat Its just tough   But that doesnt mean impossible   Keep trying trying   You are worth it and send a link to your book Thats so impressive I wanna read,NEGATIVE

If by an awkward time you mean that your manager hasnt immediately sprung  into action at the first mention of you needing a second monitor then there could be lots of reasons for it dont take it personally  It could be that theres a set budget for WFH kit and they may have to jump through hoops to get an extension it could be that your manager wants to see how you perform before making additional investment in you it maybe the be the IT guy is a hassle to deal with    Stay clear of beating your manager occupational health  bat  having a second monitor isnt an occupational health issue its a performance issues in your case  Try to resolve the issue diplomatically possibly dropping your manager an email giving them a quick run down of what youve achieved in your first week and include a line that your productivity would be increased if you had a second monitor   Failing that as its your first week in the job and not having a second monitor is causing you so much stress that youre posting on here  for the sake of your own sanity I would suggest you buy the additional monitor yourself  Good  inch screens are available for less than  If you do then drop your manager a note letting them know you have theyll see it as youre investing in your position  If your PCLaptop is running Windows  and you have full use of both hands and  dont wantcant buy your own second monitor and your manager doesnt come through with one then make do with what you have  You can use fast window switching Windows Key  Ctrl  Left Arrow and Windows Key  Ctrl  Right Arrow  I use it all the time when working on my laptop and have to compare data sets or documents its just like having a second screen,NEGATIVE
