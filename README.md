#1. Introduction

The Masters in Applied Data Science Program at Syracuse University offered me an opportunity to learn the end to end aspects of the data science practice. It helped me how to identify the business problem, develop strategies for the problems, by collecting and organizing data, analyze the data systematically by doing EDA, statical analysis and data mining.

It also helped me to effectively communicate the findings, both good and bad. Introduced the tools necessary to implement the business decisions. We will discuss in detail the learnings I had the opportunity to complete.


#2. Introduction to data science | Prof. Gary Krudys

The main objective of this course is to perform data processing and modeling using R. And determine appropriate techniques for analyzing data.

Professor Krudy&#39;s hands on approach to R made the language learning easy. He showed us the power of the ggplot package. It became my favorite plotting libraries.

On our final project we utilized the data processing steps learned in the course to clean up the survey data and applied different machine learning techniques like SVM and linear regression. We uncovered more insights using association rules for this analysis, which gave us an idea of how real-world problems are going to look like. Sophisticated algorithms might not matter, just a systematic analysis to uncover the insights.


#3. Business Analytics | Prof. Kimberly Pendelberry

The main objective of the course is do data analysis and mine data, develop strategy based on the data and make decisions. This covered all three aspects of analytics namely descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive.

Professor Pendelberry patiently answered all my questions as she introduced the basics of descriptive analytics, predictive model importance like R square, and pitfalls like multi collinearity, serial correlation and the prescriptive side of modeling using techniques like sensitivity analysis. Showed us the difference between linear, logistic, and neural networks. The in-class discussion about the articles from MIT Sloan Management review showed us a glimpse of how organizations are using analytics.

We get to practice descriptive analytics using google analytics with real Whiteman site data. Predicted book prices and recommended actions for bank loan data using prescriptive analytics.


#4. Data Analytics | Prof. Jeremy Bolton

The objective of the course is twofold, one is applying data mining techniques on real world data set , the other is to effectively tell a story about the analysis in a valuable way.

Professor Bolton set up a high bar on the story telling part specifically, made sure we submit all our reports are in a professional format.

In the Federalists Paper homework we get to try all form of clustering like k-means, hierarchical and EM(Expectation Maximization) and different distance measures like Manhattan, Euclidian and Minkowski.

In the Handwritten recognition homework, we had change to explore classification methods like decision tree and na√Øve bayes. We got introduced to feature selection/reduction methods like PCA.

On our final project we explored a time series data set and applied all data mining techniques we learned. Starting from association rule mining, k-means, knn, svm, decision tree and random forest. Tried new feature engineering techniques like lagged features.


#5. Text Mining | Prof. Amy Gates

The objective of this course is to learn basics of text mining like document representation, information extraction, text classification and clustering, and topic modeling.

Professor Gates is very practical in her approach, she encouraged us go beyond the curriculum and made us explore the state-of-the-art NLP models. And she set the highest bar in terms of report submission.

We did sentiment analysis and topic modeling for the data from twitter, reddit and news sites.


#6. Data Analysis &amp; Decision Making | Prof. Kimberly Pendelberry

The objective of this course is to select appropriate statistical technique for a given set of conditions to answer a particular question.

We explored hypothesis testing for continuous variables, chi square test for discrete variables. Get to try out kappa agreement score using Amazon Mechanical Truck for sentiment data. Got an introduction to time series data and process controls from Professor Pendelberry.

The final process improvement project gave me an opportunity to define the problem to be solved using my own data.


#7. Marketing Analytics | Prof. Raghavshyam Ramamurthy

The objective of this course is to developing marketing strategies and resource allocation decisions driven by quantitative analysis

Professor Ramamurthy took us through the full journey with marketing analytics starting with Customer Segmentation, Marketing mix models, Choice and Churn models and Conjoint analysis. We are exposed to all these models already, but the practical application of the models to business problems proved to be very tough.

Our final project gave us a change to explore all of the marketing analytics techniques we learned, and the simulation gave us an idea of how hard it is to run a multiyear marketing campaign.

#8. Big Data Analytics | Prof. Jonathan Fox

The objective of the course is to complete full lifecycle of data science from collecting data to delivering insights.

Professor Fox made the class competitive and fun. I created the highest number of models in this class. He took us through the full OSEMIN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model &amp; Interpret) cycle.

Each homework assignments pushed the limits on what we can do. The Football dataset homework made us crawl the web to augmenting external data. The timeseries Zillow dataset made us run 30 thousand models, and finally the Fashion MINIST data set made us compare all the classical approaches against Neural Networks.

The Final project &quot;COVID Detection from X-Ray Images&quot; gave us a change to produce meaningful work and also showcases the power of transfer learning in the neural networks.


#9. Information Visualization | Prof. Raghavshyam Ramamurthy

The objective of the course is to learn and practice advanced visual story telling.

Professor Ramamurthy is hands on in transforming the basic SVG plots created in R to beautiful data stories in Adobe Illustrator.

The final Netflix analytics Project gave me opportunity convey my data story in a visually appealing way.


#10. Natural Language Processing | Prof. Michael Larche

The objective of the course is to understand the levels of linguistic analysis and apply them using NLTK library

Professor Larche made the class interactive by using the async assignments in class and asking question to explain the concepts. He methodically introduced regex, Parts of Speech tagging, context free grammar, sentiment analysis and finally ended in deep learning.

The final project was structured in a way we get to use the classical NLP methods along with deep learning. Although we learned the classical NLP, working on deep learning made us question the need for the classical approaches.

#11. Quantitative Reasoning | Prof. Gregory Block

The objective of the course is to advance our understanding on the inference of the data by comparing Frequentist and Bayesian methods.

Professor Block hands on approach to explain frequentist and the corresponding Bayesian equivalents like High Density Interval, Markov chain - Monte Carlo methods and Bayes Factor.

The Final exam gave us a chance to apply all the Bayesian techniques and compare it with the frequentist methods.

#12. Conclusion

The program increased my knowledge and confidence in the data science practice.
