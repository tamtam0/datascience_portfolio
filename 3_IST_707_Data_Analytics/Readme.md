**1. FEDERALIST PAPERS**

**Objective**

The initially written Constitution of the United States of America, the articles of confederation, granted Congress the power to conduct foreign policy, maintain armed forces, and print money. But in practice, this centralized government body had little authority over the individual states, including no power to levy taxes or regulate commerce, which hampered the new nation's ability to pay its outstanding debts from the Revolutionary War.


In May 1787, 55 delegates gathered in Philadelphia to address the Articles of Confederation deficiencies and the problems that had arisen from this weakened central government. The document that emerged from the Constitutional Convention went far beyond amending the Articles, however. Instead, it established an entirely new system, including a robust central government divided into legislative, executive, and judicial branches.


As soon as 39 delegates signed the proposed Constitution in September 1787, the document went to the states for ratification, igniting a furious debate between "Federalists," who favored ratification of the Constitution as written, and "Antifederalists," who opposed the Constitution and resisted giving strong and more robust control to the national government.


In support for ratification of the proposed U.S. Constitution, a series of 85 essays appeared in the Independent Journal, under the pseudonym "Publius." Addressed to "the People of the State of New York," the articles now known as the Federalist Papers were written by the statesmen Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, leading supporters of the Constitution and the vital national government it created. They would be published serially from 1787-88 in several New York newspapers. They used the pseudo name to avoid being charged for betraying the constitutional convention, which they are part of.  (Federalist Papers, n.d.)


Since the original authors used pseudo names for publication, and as the writers themselves released no complete list, no one will ever know for sure. In this analysis, we will explore some 12 articles disputed on the origin of the author.

**2. HANDWRITING RECOGNITION**

**Objective**

The U.S. Constitution mandates that a census be taken every 10 years to count all people both citizens and noncitizens living in the United States. Responding to the census is mandatory because getting a complete and accurate count of the population is critically important. An accurate count of the population serves as the basis for fair political representation and plays a vital role in many areas of public life.


The census tells us who we are and where we are going as a nation, and helps our communities determine where to build everything from schools to supermarkets, and from homes to hospitals. It helps the government decide how to distribute funds and assistance to states and localities. It is also used to draw the lines of legislative districts and reapportion the seats each State holds in Congress. (Our Censuses, n.d.)


The biggest part of census is collecting the census data and counting the responses, specifically documenting the handwritten census surveys. The survey processing is a humongous task which bring an opportunity for computers to read and recognize the human text. We will be exploring statistical methods which can solve

**3. Stock Market Analysis**

**Objective**

An informationally efficient capital market is one in which the current security price fully, quickly, and rationally reflects all available information about that security. An academic might say, "Given all available information, current securities prices are unbiased estimates of their values, so that the expected return on any security is just the equilibrium return necessary to compensate investors for the risk regarding its future cash flows." Simply put, "You can'  t beat the market." Investors should use a passive investment strategy in a perfectly efficient market because active investment strategies will underperform due to transaction costs and management fees. So here are our questions: How efficient is the market? Can we beat the market?  

Professor Eugene Fama originally developed the market efficiency concept and identified three market efficiency forms: weak-form, semi-strong form, and strong-form market efficiency.  The weak form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) states that the current security price fully reflects all currently available security market data. Thus, past price and volume (market) information will have no predictive power about security prices' future direction. Price changes will be independent of one period to the next. An investor cannot achieve positive risk-adjusted returns on average in a weak-form efficient market using technical analysis. We attempted to explore and test the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis through this project by applying two different approaches and a series of machine learning algorithms.
